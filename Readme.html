<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This ASM package enables you to set custom boundaries of your level.</p>

<p>Also comes with a feature to have a <abbr title="Flip screen effect">Megaman/Celeste/Zelda-styled scroll areas where the camera will not cross between areas unless you go to that area</abbr>.</p>

<p>Normally, you would think this is redundant because there exist other codes that stops the screen scrolling at a certain XY position, say one
found in the <a href="https://www.smwcentral.net/?p=viewthread&t=62286">ASM library</a>, however this ASM package offers more flexibility, and that
you can have &ldquo;multiple scroll stops&rdquo; without duplicate code</p>

<h2><a href="#NoteBeforeUse_Back" id="NoteBeforeUse">^</a>Note before use</h2>
<ul>
	<li>The patch (<kbd>ScrollLimitsPatch.asm</kbd>) obviously will hijack scrolling related codes (<kbd>$00F73C</kbd> (horizontal level limits for left and right borders), <kbd>$00F893</kbd>
	(horizontal and vertical limits for top and bottom borders)). If you wish to have other scrolling-related patches such as my <a href="https://www.smwcentral.net/?p=section&a=details&id=26861">&ldquo;Center scroll&rdquo; patch</a>
	or <a href="https://www.smwcentral.net/?p=section&a=details&id=17737">Vertical Camera Panning</a>. In these cases, you'll need to merge the ASM files (more specifically, not to use SMW's default scroll limits but
	use this custom scroll limits patch's RAM that controls the limits). This patch itself just modifies the limits, nothing more.</li><br>
	<li>SMW's horizontal scrolling is instant-- that it simply takes Mario's X position, take various calculations handled at <kbd>$00F73C</kbd> (which also handles the left and right limits), unlike vertical scrolling,
	which that is handled at <kbd>$00F88F</kbd>, horizontal scrolling <b>instantly</b> sets the screen X position within the level rather than gradually incrementing/decrementing it. So these situations should be avoided that causes
	layer 1 graphic glitches due to not giving it frames to load the columns of 16x16 tiles:
		<ul>
			<li>Teleporting the player, as in taking the player's X position (<kbd>$94</kbd>), add or subtract by some large number (greater than &plusmn;$0010) that results the player being &ldquo;teleported&rdquo; in long distances.</li><br>
			<li>Have horizontal scrolling disabled (<kbd>$1411</kbd> set to $00), then enable horizontal scrolling while the player is outside the static camera region. This will cause the camera to jump to be centered
			with the player</li><br>
		</ul>
	
	</li><br>
	<li>RAM address <kbd>$13F2</kbd> is no longer cleared by <kbd>$00F8A7</kbd>.</li><br>
	<li>Anytime you want to trigger a flip-screen effect, I <b>highly</b> recommend setting <kbd>$1411</kbd> and/or <kbd>$1412</kbd> to zero (disable horizontal and/or vertical scrolling). Even though uberasm tool already
	STZs it, if you don't disable horizontal and/or scrolling and your code is executed, then runs <kbd>$00F70D</kbd> or <kbd>$00F75C</kbd>, before executing uberasm tool's gamemode 14, screen-jumping (screen changes position instantly
	and result graphical glitches) can still occur.</li><br>
	<li>Setting <kbd>$1411</kbd> and <kbd>$1412</kbd> only disables the default scrolling (the behavior of the screen to follow the player) as well as the scrolling limit not to go outside the level. Autoscroll generators have done this
	so that the player cannot move the screen as they wish.</li><br>
	<li>When the screen is at the bottommost of the level (with LM's &ldquo;Allow viewing full bottom row of tiles&rdquo; being checked in the &ldquo;Change Properties in Header&rdquo; dialog.), the screen's Y position is showing 1 pixel row
	<b>beyond</b> the bottom of the level (for example: with the level dimension setting (horizontal level mode) set to <kbd>08: Level Height=02A tiles, Max H-Screens=15</kbd>), and have the camera position at <kbd>Y=$01C0</kbd>, you can see
	last row of pixels at the bottom of the screen showing the top pixels of garbage/unloaded blocks. It seems that the screen display seems to be 1 pixel lower than the values presented in the SNES register $210E/RAM $1C/RAM $1464. The easy fix
	is to simply move the custom border 1 pixel up (in this example, the Y position of the screen should be <kbd>$01BF</kbd>).</li><br>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><a href="https://www.smwcentral.net/?p=section&a=details&id=13675">Sprite scroll fix</a>: SMW's system to check which scroll direction sprites should be able to spawn (<kbd>$55</kbd>/<kbd>$56</kbd>) is flawed, that it
	check which side the player is located relative to the &ldquo;static camera region&rdquo; (<kbd>$142A</kbd>), rather than the actual scrolling of the screen. This bug only happens if you &ldquo;manually&rdquo; scroll the screen,
	common method is by setting <kbd>$1411</kbd> to zero and incrementing/decrementing <kbd>$1462</kbd>, can cause sprites to spawn on the side of the screen that the screen is moving away from rather than towards, and failing to spawn.</li><br>
	<li><a href="https://www.smwcentral.net/?p=section&a=details&id=14978">Disable Screen Barrier via RAM</a>: Useful if you want such triggers that would trigger the flip-screen effect by touching the very edges of the screen, and also
	prevent potential deaths caused by being at those edges of the screen.</li><br>
	<li>
		ASM knowledge, if you're using other scrolling-related patches (like my previously mentioned &ldquo;center scroll&rdquo; patch), then there is a chance you'll have to modify them (and/or merge them if the hijacks overlap), especially if those patches have code that sets the scrolling limit itself:
		<ul>

			<li><a href="https://www.smwcentral.net/?p=section&a=details&id=14268">Ersanio's ASM tutorial</a></li>
		</ul><br>
		
		Here is a hint: XY position top and left positions are <b>always</b> X/Y = <kbd>$0000</kbd>. The right and bottom limits are:
		<ul>
			<li>Horizontal levels (and any dimension settings): <kbd>LastScreenXPosition = (ValueIn_RAM_5E - 1) * 256</kbd>. The bottom position is stored in scratch RAM <kbd>$04</kbd> during around <kbd>$00F810</kbd>. Unlike <kbd>$13D7</kbd>, LM have a feature with an option to enable the screen
			to scroll down to show the last row of blocks at the very bottom of the level, on &ldquo;Change Properties in Header&rdquo;.</li><br>
			<li>Vertical levels: The last screen on the horizontal axis is <b>always</b> at X = <kbd>$0100</kbd> (since vertical level settings are always 2 screens wide). The bottom position is at <kbd>LastScreenYPosition = (ValueIn_RAM_5F - 1) * 256</kbd>.</li><br>

<h2><a href="#InterestingFacts_Back" id="InterestingFacts">^</a>Interesting facts</h2>
<ul>
	<li>When horizontal and/or vertical scrolling are disabled (<kbd>$1411</kbd> and/or <kbd>$1412</kbd>), the boundaries (left or right for horizontal, top and bottom for vertical) are no longer running (it will not set the XY coordinate of
	the screen to place it back in bounds).</li><br>

<h2><a href="#Installation_Back" id="Installation">^</a>Installation</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>Defines</li><br>
		<ol>
			<li>Open <kbd>SMW-Scroll-limits/ScrollLimitsDefines/Defines.asm</kbd>, and make any necessary changes on it. There is a very high chance you'll need to do this if you have other ASM resources that uses freeram as well, as they
			tend to &ldquo;overlap&rdquo; with the default RAMs the patch provided here uses. And yes, even the required patches <a href="#WhatYouNeed">listed on this document</a> needs to have its freeram defines changed to avoid issues.</li><br>
		</ol>
		<li>Patches</li><br>
		<ol>
			<li>Before you patch <kbd>ScrollLimitsPatch.asm</kbd> or other patches related to scrolling, open <kbd>ScrollLimitsPatch.asm</kbd> AND the other patches (specifically if they hijack scrolling-related code) and see the
			<kbd>org $xxxxxx</kbd> would conflict. If they do, you'll need to merge them and potentially need to learn a little bit of ASM.<br><br>
			
			<kbd>ScrollLimitsPatch.asm</kbd> just modifies the behavior how scrolling limits work. If you say, install my &ldquo;Center Scroll&rdquo; patch, for example, edit the center scroll patch's scroll limits so that it first checks
			the RAM defined by <kbd>!Freeram_ScrollLimitsFlag</kbd>, and if it is nonzero, then it should do something similar how the patch provided here works (which means you'll need to learn about ASM).</li><br>

	</ol>
<h2><a href="#LevelUsage_Back" id="LevelUsage">^</a>How to use them in a level</h2>
	<p>
		This is pretty easy, we need these types of information for its effects to apply:
		<ul>
			<li>Enabling the borders by setting <kbd>!Freeram_ScrollLimitsFlag</kbd> to <kbd>$01</kbd>. Note that values <kbd>$02+</kbd> are reserved for the flip-screen effect not handled by the patch itself.</li><br>
			
			<li>X and Y position (in pixels), which are RAM used under the defines
			<kbd>!Freeram_ScrollLimitsBoxXPosition</kbd> and <kbd>!Freeram_ScrollLimitsBoxYPosition</kbd>.</li><br>
			
			<li>Width and height (in pixels), which are RAM used in the defines <kbd>!Freeram_ScrollLimitsAreaWidth</kbd> and <kbd>!Freeram_ScrollLimitsAreaHeight</kbd>.</li><br>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p>You can now set your own borders. Keep these information in mind:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><font color="grey">Grey</font> means outside the level boundaries.</li><br>
		<li><font color="blue">blue</font> means inside the level boundaries.</li><br>
		<li><font color="cyan">cyan</font> means the game screen.</li><br>
		<li><font color="#800000">red</font> means the boundaries specified by the RAM the patch uses.</li><br>
		<li><font color="orange">orange</font> means the actual scrolling stopping position for the bottom and right borders, relation to the screen's bottom and right borders.</li><br>
	</ul>
	<h3>Scroll stopping positions info</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Ram address defined in <kbd>!Freeram_ScrollLimitsBoxXPosition</kbd> and <kbd>!Freeram_ScrollLimitsBoxYPosition</kbd> represent the location of this
		&ldquo;area&rdquo;, meaning all 4 &ldquo;borders&rdquo; will move when these XY position gets changed.<br><br>
		
		Now keep in mind, almost everything have their origin position at the top-left of some kind of box, the screen is no exception:<br>
		<img src="readme_files/LevelAndGameScreen.png"><br></li><br>
		<li>Soo, how the right and bottom borders are placed then? Well, it takes the X/Y position, add by the value by Width/Height, in pixels (stored in
		RAM defined as <kbd>!Freeram_ScrollLimitsAreaWidth</kbd> and <kbd>!Freeram_ScrollLimitsAreaHeight</kbd>) and that will be
		the right and bottom borders position:<br>
		<img src="readme_files/ScrollLimitsBox.png"></li><br>
		<li>The top and left is pretty obvious on where the screen will stop at:<br>
		<img src="readme_files/LeftAndTop.png"><br>
		However, the bottom and right borders, they take the screen's origin position to limit instead of the right and bottom edge of the screen:<br>
		<img src="readme_files/RightAndBottom.png"><br>
		</li><br>
	</ul>
	<h4>Setting the borders up</h4>
	<p>
		Lunar Magic thankfully have this feature of &ldquo;Game view screen&rdquo; (found in the menubar on <kbd>view</kbd>). Have that, along with the 16x16 block
		coordinate display at the bottom-left corner (to convert block-coordinates to pixel, simply multiply them by 16 (<kbd>$10</kbd>) (example:
		<kbd>($0002,$0003)</kbd> in block coordinates is <kbd>($0020,$0030)</kbd> in pixel-coordinates)). Also note that LM versions before 3.03 (2019-04-01) displays the coordinates in decimal,
		while on and after 3.03 displays them in hex.
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>
			Obtain the X/Y positions by placing the screen display on LM at the top-leftmost area you want to place your limits at (make sure it is
			aligned with block grid). Now hover your mouse on the top-leftmost block that is at the top-left of the screen. We now have the X and Y
			position of the area. Remember that LM shows the coordinates in units of 16x16 blocks, not pixels, so to convert to pixel you multiply these by 16.
		</li><br>
		<li>
			Do the exact same thing, but on the bottom-rightmost. Obtain the coordinate of the block that is on the top-leftmost of that screen.
		</li><br>
		<li>
			After obtaining those stuff, we can calculate to find the widths and heights:
			<kbd>WidthOrHeights = (LM_CoordinateOfTopLeft_BottomOrRightmost_Screen-LM_CoordinateOfTopLeft_TopOrLeftmost_Screen)*16</kbd><br>
			Where:
			<ul>
				<li>
					<kbd>LM_CoordinateOfTopLeft_TopOrLeftmost_Screen</kbd>: means the top left of the screen at the leftmost position possible, in block-coordinates (not pixel), either X or Y position
				</li><br>
				<li>
					<kbd>LM_CoordinateOfTopLeft_BottomOrRightmost_Screen</kbd>: means the top-left of the screen at the rightmost position possible, in block-coordinates (not pixel), either X or Y position
				</li><br>
			</ul>
			Thankfully assemblers allow putting a formula (such as Asar), from my testing, make sure they do not have spaces.
		</li><br>
		<li>
			Have an ASM code using this template. This assumes you are using uberasm tool's level under load/init/main label:
<table><tr><td><pre>incsrc "../ScrollLimitsDefines/Defines.asm"
;^this may be different depending on where you place the defines folder. It is a
;file path to obtain the defines so that the assembler knows what these defines are.

	;These defines are separate from the defines file since this apply to a specific level:
		!PerLevelScrollLimitXPosition = ($000E)*16
		!PerLevelScrollLimitYPosition = ($0004)*16
		!PerLevelBorderWidth = ($001E-$000E)*16
		!PerLevelBorderHeight = ($0008-$0004)*16
	load:
	LDA #$01					;\Enable borders
	STA !Freeram_ScrollLimitsFlag			;/

	SEP #$20
	JSL LibraryScrollLimits_ForceScreenWithinLimits	;&gt;Call this AFTER setting up the borders.
	RTL</pre></td></tr></table><br>

			Do note that this <b>sets the screen position</b>, when the player attempts to move the screen, so screen jumping can occur and display glitched (unloaded) layer 1 and 2 graphics.
			Use this code during level loading is recommended.<br><br>
			
			Also be careful that some freeram addresses may clear during level loading, I'm not sure if uberasm tool's <kbd>load</kbd> happens after or before clearing RAM, the default RAMs here were tested and
			does not to it seems safe. If you are unsure, check out the RAM map.<br><br>
			
			Furthermore, if you have borders that can turn on/off, <b>both</b> ways can cause the screen to jump within bounds or jump to position so that the static camera region is on the player.<br><br>
			
			To avoid screen jumping, I recommend setting <kbd>!Freeram_ScrollLimitsFlag</kbd> to <kbd>$02</kbd> (screen gradually scrolls to be within bounds closest to the player) or <kbd>$03</kbd> (same as <kbd>$02</kbd>
			but also temporally freezes the game). Don't forget to set <kbd>$1411</kbd> and <kbd>$1412</kbd> to zero just in case.

		The tables, labeled <kbd>ScreenBoundsXPositions</kbd>, <kbd>ScreenBoundsYPositions</kbd>, <kbd>ScreenBoundsWidths</kbd>, and <kbd>ScreenBoundsHeights</kbd>, is what we need to focus on.
		Keep in mind that each same nth item in each table are associated with each other, meaning that the first item in the tables are used together for <kbd>zone 0</kbd> (index 0), second item in tables for <kbd>zone 1</kbd> (index 1), and so on,

				<li>Uberasm tool's level <kbd>load</kbd> code.</li><br>
				<li>A few frames later, executes SMW's scrolling code routine (both Mario moving the screen as well as the scrolling limits), such as <kbd>$00F893</kbd>.</li><br>
				<li>A frame afterwards, <kbd>$00f79d</kbd> is executed again, realized layer 1 XY pos has been changed, causing the layer 2 background to jump.</li><br>
			</ol>
			Therefore, LM will set the layer 2 XY pos, using layer 1 XY pos that was BEFORE it was moved to be within bounds, a frame afterwards, layer 1 XY pos got updated (now in-bounds) and
			the background XY pos update to use that new layer 1 position.<br><br>
			
			One way to fix this is by after Layer 2 has been shifted, using a debugger (bsnes plus), set a breakpoint at address <kbd>$00f79d</kbd> under &ldquo;execute&rdquo;, and use the <kbd>step</kbd>
			function to see how the code is executed to calculate the position of layer 2. Try to mimic that using uberasm tool under the <kbd>level</kbd> under <kbd>load</kbd>. While the X position never
			changes based on the player's level entrance, the Y position may vary using <kbd><a href="https://smwc.me/m/smw/ram/7E1417/">$1417</a></kbd>, so keep that in mind.
		</li><br>
		
		<li>If you have set the custom borders to extend outside the level boundaries, don't worry, both the main patch <kbd>ScrollLimitsPatch.asm</kbd> and uberasm tool code <kbd>library/LibraryScrollLimits.asm</kbd> have
		a failsafe measure to prevent the screen and the scrolling destination position from leaving the level, regardless the RAM defined in <kbd>!Freeram_ScrollLimitsFlag</kbd> being nonzero or not.</li><br>
