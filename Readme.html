<center><h1>Custom scroll limits</h1></center>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This ASM package enables you to set custom boundaries of your level</p>

<p>Normally, you would think this is redundant because there exist other codes that stops the screen scrolling at a certain XY position, say one
found in the <a href="https://www.smwcentral.net/?p=viewthread&t=62286">ASM library</a>, however this ASM package offers more flexibility, and that
you can have &ldquo;multiple scroll stops&rdquo; without duplicate code</p>
<h2>Note before use</h2>
<ul>
	<li>This patch obviously will hijack scrolling related codes (<kbd>$00F73C</kbd> (horizontal level limits for left and right borders), <kbd>$00F893</kbd>
	(horizontal and vertical limits for top and bottom borders)). If you wish to have other scrolling-related patches such as my <a href="https://www.smwcentral.net/?p=section&a=details&id=26861">Center scroll patch</a>
	or <a href="https://www.smwcentral.net/?p=section&a=details&id=17737">Vertical Camera Panning</a>. In these cases, you'll need to merge the ASM files (more specifically, not to use SMW's default scroll limits but
	use this custom scroll limits patch's RAM that controls the limits)</li>
	<li>SMW's horizontal scrolling is instant-- that it simply takes Mario's X position, take various calculations handled at <kbd>$00F73C</kbd> (which also handles the left and right limits), unlike vertical scrolling,
	which is handled at <kbd>$00F88F</kbd>, offsets the Y position gradually towards the player. Therefore, if these boundaries get turned off, and the screen jumps into that &ldquo;opened area&rdquo;, tile loading graphic glitches
	can occur.</li>
</ul>
