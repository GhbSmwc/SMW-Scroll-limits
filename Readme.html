<center><h1>Custom scroll limits</h1></center>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This ASM package enables you to set custom boundaries of your level</p>

<p>Normally, you would think this is redundant because there exist other codes that stops the screen scrolling at a certain XY position, say one
found in the <a href="https://www.smwcentral.net/?p=viewthread&t=62286">ASM library</a>, however this ASM package offers more flexibility, and that
you can have &ldquo;multiple scroll stops&rdquo; without duplicate code</p>
<h2>Note before use</h2>
<ul>
	<li>This patch obviously will hijack scrolling related codes (<kbd>$00F73C</kbd> (horizontal level limits for left and right borders), <kbd>$00F893</kbd>
	(horizontal and vertical limits for top and bottom borders)). If you wish to have other scrolling-related patches such as my <a href="https://www.smwcentral.net/?p=section&a=details&id=26861">Center scroll patch</a>
	or <a href="https://www.smwcentral.net/?p=section&a=details&id=17737">Vertical Camera Panning</a>. In these cases, you'll need to merge the ASM files (more specifically, not to use SMW's default scroll limits but
	use this custom scroll limits patch's RAM that controls the limits)</li>
	<li>SMW's horizontal scrolling is instant-- that it simply takes Mario's X position, take various calculations handled at <kbd>$00F73C</kbd> (which also handles the left and right limits), unlike vertical scrolling,
	which is handled at <kbd>$00F88F</kbd>, offsets the Y position gradually towards the player. Therefore, if these boundaries get turned off, and the screen jumps into that &ldquo;opened area&rdquo;, tile loading graphic glitches
	can occur.</li>
	<li>RAM address <kbd>$13F2</kbd> is no longer cleared by <kbd>$00F8A7</kbd>.</li>
	<li>Anytime you want to trigger a &ldquo;flip screen&rdquo; effect, I <b>highly</b> recommend setting <kbd>$1411</kbd> and <kbd>$1412</kbd> to zero (disable horizontal and vertical scrolling). Even though uberasm tool already
	STZs it, if you don't disable horizontal scrolling and your code is executed, then runs <kbd>$00F70D</kbd> or <kbd>$00F75C</kbd>, before executing uberasm tool's gamemode 14, SMW's horizontal will, for 1 frame, assume
	that horizontal scrolling is enabled, and does its default action and may causes scrolling issues.</li>
	<li>Setting <kbd>$1411</kbd> and <kbd>$1412</kbd> only disables the default scrolling (the behavior of the screen to follow the player) as well as the scrolling limit not to go left past the screen $00 or go right past the last
	screen. Autoscroll generators have done this.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Required patches</h2>
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://www.smwcentral.net/?p=section&a=details&id=13675">Sprite scroll fix</a>: The system to check which scroll direction sprites should be able to spawn (<kbd>$55</kbd>/<kbd>$56</kbd>) is flawed, that it
	check which side the player is located relative to the &ldquo;static camera region&rdquo; (<kbd>$142A</kbd>), rather than the actual scrolling of the screen.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Interesting facts</h2>
<ul>
	<li>When horizontal and/or vertical scrolling are disabled (<kbd>$1411</kbd> and/or <kbd>$1412</kbd>), the boundaries are no longer running (it will not set the XY coordinate of the screen to place it back in bounds).</li>
</ul>
