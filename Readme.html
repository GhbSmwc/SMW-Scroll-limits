<center><h1>Custom scroll limits</h1></center>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
	This ASM package enables you to set custom scroll boundaries of your level. Very useful for:
	<ul>
		<li>Making sure the camera focuses on the playable area and not potentially in the ground/ceiling/wall, especially 1-screen sections.</li><br>
		<li>Re-use levels without the camera to be able to suspiciously scroll outside the &ldquo;sub-room&rdquo;</li><br>
		<li>Hidden secret behind the walls without suspicious camera scrolling. Hacks like <i>The Second Reality Project Reloaded</i> and <i>New Super Mario World 2: Around The World</i> have a tendency that in some rooms, on the far-right (or left)
		of the area, if the camera scrolls further into the wall than it should, then there is a chance there is an hidden opening.</li><br>
		<li>Hide cutoffs, if they're areas in your levels that are out-of-bounds, you don't need to place decoration tiles there to prevent cutoff, if the screen cannot go there.</li><br>
		<li>Custom bottomless pits heights. Which gives the feeling to the player that they are essentially at the bottom of the level.</li><br>
		<li>Boss rooms.</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<p>Also comes with a feature to have a <abbr title="Flip screen effect">Megaman/Celeste/Zelda-styled scroll areas where the camera will not cross between areas unless you go to that area</abbr>.</p>

<p>Normally, you would think this is redundant because there exist other codes that stops the screen scrolling at a certain XY position, say one
found in the <a href="https://www.smwcentral.net/?p=viewthread&t=62286">ASM library</a>, however this ASM package offers more flexibility, and that
you can have &ldquo;multiple scroll stops&rdquo; without duplicate code.</p>

<h2><a href="#NoteBeforeUse_Back" id="NoteBeforeUse">^</a>Note before use</h2>
<ul>
	<li>The patch (<kbd>ScrollLimitsPatch.asm</kbd>) obviously will hijack scrolling related codes (<kbd>$00F73C</kbd> (horizontal level limits for left and right borders), <kbd>$00F893</kbd>
	(horizontal and vertical limits for top and bottom borders)). If you wish to have other scrolling-related patches such as my <a href="https://www.smwcentral.net/?p=section&a=details&id=26861">&ldquo;Center scroll&rdquo; patch</a>
	or <a href="https://www.smwcentral.net/?p=section&a=details&id=17737">Vertical Camera Panning</a>. In these cases, you'll need to merge the ASM files (more specifically, not to use SMW's default scroll limits but
	use this custom scroll limits patch's RAM that controls the limits). This patch itself just modifies the limits, nothing more.</li><br>
	<li>SMW's horizontal scrolling is instant-- that it simply takes Mario's X position, take various calculations handled at <kbd>$00F73C</kbd> (which also handles the left and right limits, to prevent scrolling left past screen 0, or the
	last screen), unlike vertical scrolling, which that is handled at <kbd>$00F88F</kbd>, horizontal scrolling <b>instantly</b> sets the screen X position within the level rather than gradually incrementing/decrementing it. So these
	situations should be avoided that causes layer 1 graphic glitches due to not giving it frames to load the columns of 16x16 tiles:
		<ul>
			<li>Teleporting the player, as in taking the player's X position (<kbd>$94</kbd>), add or subtract by some large number (greater than &plusmn;$0010) that results the player being &ldquo;teleported&rdquo; in long distances.</li><br>
			<li>Have horizontal scrolling disabled (<kbd>$1411</kbd> set to $00), then enable horizontal scrolling while the player is outside the static camera region. This will cause the camera to jump to be centered
			with the player</li><br>
		</ul>
	
	</li><br>
	<li>RAM address <kbd>$13F2</kbd> is no longer cleared by <kbd>$00F8A7</kbd>.</li><br>
	<li>Anytime you want to trigger a flip-screen effect (setting a RAM <kbd>!Freeram_ScrollLimitsFlag</kbd> to <kbd>$02</kbd> or <kbd>$03</kbd>), I <b>highly</b> recommend setting <kbd>$1411</kbd> and/or <kbd>$1412</kbd> to zero
	(disable horizontal and/or vertical scrolling). Even though uberasm tool already STZs it, if you don't disable horizontal and/or scrolling and your code is executed, then runs <kbd>$00F70D</kbd> or <kbd>$00F75C</kbd>, before
	executing uberasm tool's gamemode 14, screen-jumping (screen changes position instantly and result graphical glitches) can still occur.</li><br>
	<li>Setting <kbd>$1411</kbd> and <kbd>$1412</kbd> only disables the default scrolling (the behavior of the screen to follow the player) as well as the scrolling limit not to go outside the level. Autoscroll generators have done this
	so that the player cannot move the screen as they wish.</li><br>
	<li>It seems that whenever you set the screen's Y position, it appears 1 pixel lower than it should, similarly to how sprites are being displayed. Not sure why this occurs.</li><br>
	<li><span id="BlockEnableDisableSolidBorders">Since this utilizes the <a href="https://www.smwcentral.net/?p=section&a=details&id=14978">Disable Screen Barrier via RAM</a> patch, you have to</span>:
	<ul>
		<li>Prevent the player from going outside the level, such as using blocks or toggling the RAM so that the borders are active when the player is too far to the left or right, along with enabling bottomless pits.</li><br>
		<li>Toggle the RAM if you want certain areas to feature bottomless pits (that would kill the player, teleport using <a href="https://www.smwcentral.net/?p=section&a=details&id=20011">Teleport By Falling Off Screen</a>) and/or other effects
		related to using the bottomless pits.</li><br>
	</ul>
	You can easily have blocks that would set/clear the RAM <kbd>!Freeram_DisableBarrier</kbd>. Shouldn't be hard:
<table><tr><td><pre>!Freeram_DisableBarrier = $60 ;&gt;Change this to some other RAM!

	Although I could copy the way how <a href="https://www.smwcentral.net/?p=section&a=details&id=22371">Single screen</a> merely turns off the left and right border, I would like it so that it have a low chance of future hijack conflicts in your hack.
	They both (Disable Screen Barrier and Single screen) hijack at <kbd>$00E98C</kbd>. I also cautioned the use of <a href="https://www.smwcentral.net/?p=section&a=details&id=13147">pit fix patch</a> if set too high (or close if the player
	falls down fast enough), the player could trigger the bottomless pit as the screen attempts to scroll downwards (the bottomless pit is actually at the bottom of the screen, not always the bottom of the level).</li><br>

<h2><a href="#WhatYouNeed_Back" id="WhatYouNeed">^</a>What you need</h2>
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://www.smwcentral.net/?p=section&a=details&id=13675">Sprite scroll fix</a>: SMW's system to check which scroll direction sprites should be able to spawn (<kbd>$55</kbd>/<kbd>$56</kbd>) is flawed, that it
	check which side the player is located relative to the &ldquo;static camera region&rdquo; (<kbd>$142A</kbd>), rather than the actual scrolling of the screen. This bug only happens if you &ldquo;manually&rdquo; scroll the screen,
	common method is by setting <kbd>$1411</kbd> to zero and incrementing/decrementing <kbd>$1462</kbd>, can cause sprites to spawn on the side of the screen that the screen is moving away from rather than towards, and failing to spawn.</li><br>
	<li><a href="https://www.smwcentral.net/?p=section&a=details&id=14978">Disable Screen Barrier via RAM</a>: This is needed for the flip screen effect, because Mario have to be at the <i>very edge</i> of the left and right side of the screen
	to trigger it (left border would set Mario's position at <kbd>X=$0008</kbd>, and right border would be set to <kbd>X=$00E8</kbd>, relative to the screen, which prevents the player from being able to trigger the effect).</li><br>
	<ul>
		<li>This also means if you wanted bottomless pits in some areas in your level, have blocks that would do <a href="#BlockEnableDisableSolidBorders">as previously mentioned</a></li>
	</ul>
	<li>
		ASM knowledge, if you're using other scrolling-related patches (like my previously mentioned &ldquo;center scroll&rdquo; patch), then there is a chance you'll have to modify them (and/or merge them if the hijacks overlap), especially if those patches have code that sets the scrolling limit itself:
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://www.smwcentral.net/?p=section&a=details&id=20949">ASM workshop</a></li>
			<li><a href="https://www.smwcentral.net/?p=section&a=details&id=14268">Ersanio's ASM tutorial</a></li>
		</ul><br>
		
		An easy way to find and modify its code to respect this ASM gimmick is by noting this info: XY position left and top positions are <b>always</b> X/Y = <kbd>$0000</kbd>. The right and bottom limits are:
		<ul>
			<li>Horizontal levels (and any dimension settings): <kbd>LastScreenXPosition = (ValueIn_RAM_5E - 1) * 256</kbd>. The bottom position is stored in scratch RAM <kbd>$04</kbd> during around <kbd>$00F810</kbd>. Unlike <kbd>$13D7</kbd>, LM have a feature with an option to enable the screen
			to scroll down to show the last row of blocks at the very bottom of the level, on &ldquo;Change Properties in Header&rdquo;.</li><br>
			<li>Vertical levels: The last screen on the horizontal axis is <b>always</b> at X = <kbd>$0100</kbd> (since vertical level settings are always 2 screens wide). The bottom position is at <kbd>LastScreenYPosition = (ValueIn_RAM_5F - 1) * 256</kbd>.</li><br>
		</ul>
	</li><br>
	<li>
		<a href="https://github.com/devinacker/bsnes-plus">Bsnes plus</a>, features a debugger, mainly to figure out where to position layer 2 <a href="#Layer2JumpAfterLoad">so that it doesn't jump after the level loads if the player's screen is outside the scroll border</a>.

		<a href="https://www.smwcentral.net/?p=section&a=details&id=26516">Address tracker</a>, The scroll limits resource here does eat up quite handful of bytes, use that along with the defines

<ul>
	<li>When horizontal and/or vertical scrolling are disabled (<kbd>$1411</kbd> and/or <kbd>$1412</kbd>), the boundaries (left or right for horizontal, top and bottom for vertical) are no longer running (it will not set the XY coordinate of
	the screen to place it back in bounds), not just the player being able to move the screen.</li><br>

	<ol>
		<li>Defines</li><br>
		<ol>
			<li>Open <kbd>SMW-Scroll-limits/ScrollLimitsDefines/Defines.asm</kbd>, and make any necessary changes on it. There is a very high chance you'll need to do this if you have other ASM resources that uses freeram as well, as they
			tend to &ldquo;overlap&rdquo; with the default RAMs the patch provided here uses. And yes, even the required patches <a href="#WhatYouNeed">listed on this document</a> need to have its freeram defines changed to avoid issues.</li><br>
		</ol>
		<li>Patches</li><br>
		<ol>
			<li>Before you patch <kbd>ScrollLimitsPatch.asm</kbd> or other patches related to scrolling, open <kbd>ScrollLimitsPatch.asm</kbd> AND the other patches (specifically if they hijack scrolling-related code) and see the
			<kbd>org $xxxxxx</kbd> would conflict. If they do, you'll need to merge them and potentially need to learn a little bit of ASM.<br><br>
			
			<kbd>ScrollLimitsPatch.asm</kbd> just modifies the behavior how scrolling limits work. If you say, install my &ldquo;Center Scroll&rdquo; patch, for example, edit the center scroll patch's scroll limits so that it first checks
			the RAM defined by <kbd>!Freeram_ScrollLimitsFlag</kbd>, and if it is nonzero, then it should do something similar how the patch provided here works (which also means you'll need to learn about ASM).</li><br>

<h2><a href="#LevelUsage_Back" id="LevelUsage">^</a>How to use them in a level</h2>
	<p>
		This is pretty easy, we need these types of information for its effects to apply:
		<ul>
			<li>Enabling the borders by setting <kbd>!Freeram_ScrollLimitsFlag</kbd> to <kbd>$01</kbd>. Note that values <kbd>$02+</kbd> are reserved for the flip-screen effect not handled by the patch itself.</li><br>
			
			<li>X and Y position (in pixels), which are RAM used under the defines
			<kbd>!Freeram_ScrollLimitsBoxXPosition</kbd> and <kbd>!Freeram_ScrollLimitsBoxYPosition</kbd>.</li><br>
			
			<li>Width and height (in pixels), which are RAM used in the defines <kbd>!Freeram_ScrollLimitsAreaWidth</kbd> and <kbd>!Freeram_ScrollLimitsAreaHeight</kbd>.</li><br>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p>You can now set your own borders. Keep these information in mind:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><font color="grey">Grey</font> means outside the level boundaries.</li><br>
		<li><font color="blue">blue</font> means inside the level boundaries.</li><br>
		<li><font color="cyan">cyan</font> means the game screen.</li><br>
		<li><font color="#800000">red</font> means the boundaries specified by the RAM the patch uses.</li><br>
		<li><font color="orange">orange</font> means the actual scrolling stopping position for the right and bottom borders, relation to the screen's right and bottom borders.</li><br>
	</ul>
	<h3>Scroll stopping positions info</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Ram address defined in <kbd>!Freeram_ScrollLimitsBoxXPosition</kbd> and <kbd>!Freeram_ScrollLimitsBoxYPosition</kbd> represent the location of this
		&ldquo;area&rdquo;, meaning all 4 &ldquo;borders&rdquo; will move when these XY position gets changed.<br><br>
		
		Now keep in mind, almost everything have their origin position at the top-left of some kind of box, the screen is no exception:<br>
		<img src="readme_files/LevelAndGameScreen.png"><br></li><br>
		<li>So, how are the borders are placed then? Well, the XY position (in pixels) represents the left and top limit, and the width and height (<kbd>!Freeram_ScrollLimitsAreaWidth</kbd> and
		<kbd>!Freeram_ScrollLimitsAreaHeight</kbd>, also in pixels) represents the right and bottom limit, offset (added) from the XY position:<br>
		<img src="readme_files/ScrollLimitsBox.png"></li><br>
		<li>The left and top is pretty obvious on where the screen will stop at:<br>
		<img src="readme_files/LeftAndTop.png"><br>
		However, the right and bottom borders, because they take the screen's origin position to limit instead of the right and bottom edge of the screen, the screen can extend 256 pixels to the right and 224 down:<br>
		<img src="readme_files/RightAndBottom.png"><br>
		</li><br>
	</ul>
	<h4>Setting the borders up</h4>
	<p>
		Lunar Magic thankfully have this feature of &ldquo;Game view screen&rdquo; (found in the menubar on <kbd>view</kbd>, or by pressing F3). Have that, and make use of the 16x16 block
		coordinate display at the bottom-left corner (to convert block-coordinates to pixel, simply multiply them by 16 (<kbd>$10</kbd>) (example:
		<kbd>($0002,$0003)</kbd> in block coordinates is <kbd>($0020,$0030)</kbd> in pixel-coordinates)). Also note that LM versions before 3.03 (2019-04-01) displays the coordinates in decimal,
		while on and after 3.03 displays them in hex.
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>
			Obtain the X/Y positions by placing the screen display on LM at the top-leftmost area you want to place your limits at (make sure it is
			aligned with block grid, it moves in the smallest step of 8x8s). Now hover your mouse on the top-leftmost block that is at the top-left of the screen. We now have the X and Y
			position of the area. Remember that LM shows the coordinates in units of 16x16 blocks, not pixels, so to convert to pixel you multiply these by 16.
		</li><br>
		<li>
			Do the exact same thing, but on the bottom-rightmost. Obtain the coordinate of the block that is on the top-leftmost of that screen.
		</li><br>
		<li>
			After obtaining those stuff, we can calculate to find the widths and heights:
			<kbd>WidthOrHeights = (LM_CoordinateOfTopLeft_BottomOrRightmost_Screen-LM_CoordinateOfTopLeft_TopOrLeftmost_Screen)*16</kbd><br>
			Where:
			<ul>
				<li>
					<kbd>LM_CoordinateOfTopLeft_TopOrLeftmost_Screen</kbd>: means the top left of the screen at the leftmost position possible, in block-coordinates (not pixel), either X or Y position
				</li><br>
				<li>
					<kbd>LM_CoordinateOfTopLeft_BottomOrRightmost_Screen</kbd>: means the top-left of the screen at the rightmost position possible, in block-coordinates (not pixel), either X or Y position
				</li><br>
			</ul>
			Thankfully assemblers allow putting a formula (such as Asar) instead of just a single number, from my testing, make sure they do not have spaces.
		</li><br>
		<li>
			Have an ASM code using this template. This assumes you are using uberasm tool's level under load/init/main label:
<table><tr><td><pre>incsrc "../ScrollLimitsDefines/Defines.asm"
;^this may be different depending on where you place the defines folder. It is a
;file path to obtain the defines so that the assembler knows what these defines are.

	;These defines are separate from the defines file since this apply to a specific level:
		!PerLevelScrollLimitXPosition = ($000E)*16
		!PerLevelScrollLimitYPosition = ($0004)*16
		!PerLevelBorderWidth = ($001E-$000E)*16
		!PerLevelBorderHeight = ($0008-$0004)*16
	load:
	LDA #$01					;\Enable borders
	STA !Freeram_ScrollLimitsFlag			;/

	SEP #$20
	JSL LibraryScrollLimits_ForceScreenWithinLimits	;&gt;Call this AFTER setting up the borders.
	RTL</pre></td></tr></table><br>

			Do note that this <b>sets the screen position</b>, when the player attempts to move the screen, so screen jumping can occur and display glitched (unloaded) layer 1 and 2 graphics.
			Use this code during level loading is recommended.<br><br>
			
			Also be careful that some freeram addresses may clear during level loading, I'm not sure if uberasm tool's <kbd>load</kbd> happens after or before clearing RAM, the default RAMs here were tested and
			did not experience any issues. If you are unsure, check out the RAM map.<br><br>
			
			Furthermore, if you have borders that can turn on/off, <b>both</b> ways can cause the screen to jump within bounds or jump to position so that the static camera region is on the player. Situations like this
			is you have to set <kbd>!Freeram_ScrollLimitsFlag</kbd> to <kbd>$02</kbd> (scroll to player) or <kbd>$03</kbd> (same but also freezes), don't forget to zero out <kbd>$1411</kbd> and <kbd>$1412</kbd> during that code though just in case.
			This will cause the screen to gradually scroll to the player.<br><br>

;Scroll limit box attributes, each index is each screen area.
;Make sure the number of values all matches!
;
;Note: If the screen can be at the bottommost of the level and with &ldquo;Allow viewing full bottom row of tiles&rdquo;
;checked, it can show a row of pixels at the bottom of the screen of garbage/unloaded tiles. Therefore to avoid this, use
;these formulas instead (it is the same, but after all calculations, it is subtracted by 1):
;If the height is set to 0 (no room for moving the screen vertically)
; YPos = (LM_CoordinateOfTopLeft_TopOrLeftmost_Screen*16)-1
;If the height isn't 0:
; Width = ((LM_CoordinateOfTopLeft_BottomOrRightmost_Screen-LM_CoordinateOfTopLeft_TopOrLeftmost_Screen)*16)-1

;Easy formula to calculate where the screen should be at:

		The tables, labeled <kbd>ScreenBoundsXPositions</kbd>, <kbd>ScreenBoundsYPositions</kbd>, <kbd>ScreenBoundsWidths</kbd>, and <kbd>ScreenBoundsHeights</kbd>, is what we need to focus on, they're the list of scroll zones in the level.
		Keep in mind that each same nth item in each table are associated with each other, meaning that the first item in the tables are used together for <kbd>zone 0</kbd> (index 0), second item in tables for <kbd>zone 1</kbd> (index 1), and so on,
		they do not use other items within them (like zone 0 uses first item in <kbd>ScreenBoundsXPositions</kbd>, second item in <kbd>ScreenBoundsYPositions</kbd>, it doesn't work like that)</li><br>

		<li>It is pretty much the same, but we are dealing with <b>multiple</b> borders. Get their positions accordingly, here is the image using the example table and code previously mentioned:<br>

		To get the widths and heights, the formula for that is <kbd>(Block_BottomRightmost-Block_TopLeftmost)*16</kbd>, so it should be:

				<li>Uberasm tool's level <kbd>load</kbd> code.</li><br>
				<li>A few frames later, executes SMW's scrolling code routine (both Mario moving the screen as well as the scrolling limits), such as <kbd>$00F893</kbd>.</li><br>
				<li>A frame afterwards, <kbd>$00f79d</kbd> is executed again, realized layer 1 XY pos has been changed, causing the layer 2 background to jump.</li><br>
			</ol>
			Therefore, LM will set the layer 2 XY pos, using layer 1 XY pos that was BEFORE it was moved to be within bounds, a frame afterwards, layer 1 XY pos got updated (now in-bounds) and
			the background XY pos update to use that new layer 1 position.<br><br>
			
			One way to fix this is by after Layer 2 has been shifted, using a debugger (bsnes plus), set a breakpoint at address <kbd>$00f79d</kbd> under &ldquo;execute&rdquo;, and use the <kbd>step</kbd>
			function to see how the code is executed to calculate the position of layer 2. Try to mimic that using uberasm tool under the <kbd>level</kbd> under <kbd>load</kbd>. While the X position never
			changes based on the player's level entrance, the Y position may vary using <kbd><a href="https://smwc.me/m/smw/ram/7E1417/">$1417</a></kbd>, so keep that in mind.
		</li><br>
		
		<li>If you have set the custom borders to extend outside the level boundaries, don't worry, both the main patch <kbd>ScrollLimitsPatch.asm</kbd> and uberasm tool code <kbd>library/LibraryScrollLimits.asm</kbd> have
		a failsafe measure to prevent the screen and the scrolling destination position from leaving the level, regardless the RAM defined in <kbd>!Freeram_ScrollLimitsFlag</kbd> being nonzero or not.</li><br>
		
		<li>
			Because the XY position and width/heights are in units of pixels, you are not restricted to have these zones aligned with the 16x16 block grid. For example: you can have borders that are half-block position so
			that a 1-block thin wall can be visible in both zones. There the formula can be changed to this to get the <i>pixel</i> offset of the block:
			<ul>
			<li><kbd>XYPos = (LM_CoordinateXY*16)+BlockPixelOffset</kbd></li>
			<li><kbd>WidthOrHeights = ((LM_CoordinateOfTopLeft_BottomOrRightmost_Screen-LM_CoordinateOfTopLeft_TopOrLeftmost_Screen)*16)+BlockPixelOffset</kbd></li>
			</ul><br>
			Where <kbd>BlockPixelOffset</kbd> refers to how many pixels within a block rightwards or downwards, ranging <kbd>0-15</kbd> (hex: <kbd>$00-$0F</kbd>). In the mentioned example,
			a half-block is 8 pixels.
		</li>
		<li>Be careful not to have a very large number of zones for the flip screen effect with custom borders (<kbd>test_CustomBorders.asm</kbd>), since this code runs <i>every frame</i>
		checking/searching each zone the player may be in, which can cause slowdowns.<br><br>
		
		Also note that since the RAM that identify which borders the player is in (<kbd>!Freeram_FlipScreenAreaIdentifier</kbd>) is 1 byte/8-bit,
		only up to 256 zones per level can be allowed, unless you edit the code to add a condition (example: if the player is on the right-half of the level) to use a <i>separate table</i> so you can reuse zone IDs (this also
		alleviates slowdown by limiting the table searching).<br><br>
		
		The &ldquo;single screen&rdquo; version (<kbd>test_SingleScreen.asm</kbd>) does not rely on looping on an expandable table, rather it uses the player's center position (see label <kbd>IdentifyWhichBorder</kbd> in
		<kbd>UberasmTool/library</kbd>), divide by 256 (and round down) on either X or Y axis, and that will be which sub-screen boundary the current screen to be in, therefore slowdowns won't occur (unless someone finds
		a bug in the future that was poorly optimized).</li>
